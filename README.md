# Minikube in local VM
As per [Minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube) site
 > minikube implements a local Kubernetes cluster on macOS, Linux, and Windows minikube's primary goals are to be the best tool for local Kubernetes application development and to support all Kubernetes features that fit. We hope you enjoy it!
 
I have gone through serveral videos and blogs and after that I was able to deploy minikube in windows as well as in VM with oc centos 7. The centos machine I could access from putty.
To follow the installation read this [guide](minikube-install.md)
